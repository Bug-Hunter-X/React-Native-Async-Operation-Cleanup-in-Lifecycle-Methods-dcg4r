In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from improper handling of asynchronous operations within lifecycle methods, particularly `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`. For instance, consider fetching data using `fetch` or similar: 
```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
}
componentWillUnmount() {
  // Missing cleanup
}
```
If the component unmounts before the `fetch` completes, it can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, as `this.setState` may be called on an unmounted component.  This can also cause memory leaks if the component is repeatedly mounted and unmounted.
